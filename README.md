# Getting Started

## 1. Install Tailscale

Tailscale is the VPN we use to remotely connect to the different L10 servers in various locations.

To install Tailscale, visit:  
ðŸ‘‰ [https://tailscale.com/download](https://tailscale.com/download)

Once installed, contact **giovanni_leon@wistron.com** to request login credentials.

---

## 2. Know Your Location

Once Tailscale is installed and the *Wistron L10 Labs VPN* is active, you can reach each lab by visiting:  
```
[location].wistronlabs.com
```

### Current locations:
- `tss` â€” TSS in Georgetown, TX
- `frk` â€” Dell in Franklin, MA

---

## 3. Access Your Location

You can access your location in one of two ways:

### Web Portal

Each location provides a web page where you can:
- View the current status of test stations.
- Download logs from previously completed tests.

Access the web portal via:  
```
http://[location].wistronlabs.com
```

#### Station Statuses
![Stations Screenshot](https://github.com/giovannirleon/wistronlabs/blob/main/media/station_statuses.png)

- **RED** â€” No activity on the station for the day.
- **GREEN** â€” Activity detected, but no L10 test currently running.
- **YELLOW** â€” An L10 test is currently running on the station.

#### Logs
![Logs Screenshot](https://github.com/giovannirleon/wistronlabs/blob/main/media/logs.png)

Clicking on a service tag in the logs section provides:
- `output.log` â€” A copy of the on-screen output from the L10 test.
- `LOG-[DATE]-[Time].tgz` â€” The compressed log files generated after the L10 test completes.

---

### Terminal

Running and managing L10 tests is primarily done through the terminal.  
You can use any terminal client you prefer, such as:
- **MobaXterm**
- **TeraTerm**
- Built-in terminal

To access the L10 server terminal, SSH into it:
```bash
ssh falab@[location].wistronlabs.com
```

For the SSH password, please contact **giovanni_leon@wistron.com**.

# `bios_serial.sh`

This script connects to the systemâ€™s **BIOS serial console** using *Serial over LAN (SoL)* via the BMC, removing the need to physically connect to the BIOS serial USB port on the front of the system.  

Accessing the BIOS serial console is useful for advanced troubleshooting during host power-on.

## Usage

```bash
./bios_serial.sh <-i IP_ADDRESS | -m MAC_ADDRESS>
```

## Required Options (choose one)

- `-i IP_ADDRESS` â€” Specify the BMC by its **IP address**.
- `-m MAC_ADDRESS` â€” Specify the BMC by its **MAC address**.

---

# `chassis_power.sh`

This script remotely controls the host systemâ€™s power state or checks its current power status.

## Usage

```bash
./chassis_power.sh <on|off|status> <-i IP_ADDRESS | -m MAC_ADDRESS>
```

## Commands
- `on` â€” Power on the system.
- `off` â€” Power off the system.
- `status` â€” Display the systemâ€™s current power status.
  
## Required Options (choose one)

- `-i IP_ADDRESS` â€” Specify the BMC by its **IP address**.
- `-m MAC_ADDRESS` â€” Specify the BMC by its **MAC address**.

---

# `check_station.sh`

This script checks the current status of a specified station.

The status can be one of the following:
1. No TMUX session is running on the station.
2. A TMUX session is running, but no L10 test is in progress.
3. An L10 test is currently running on the station.

## Usage

```bash
./check_station.sh <station_number>
```

---

# `clear_dhcp.sh`

This script clears all DHCP leases on the DHCP server running on the L10 server.  
**Note:** This script must be run as `root`.

This is useful if systems are receiving incorrect or inconsistent IP addresses.

## Usage

```bash
sudo ./clear_dhcp.sh
```

---

# `clear_known_hosts.sh`

This script clears all **known SSH hosts** entries on the server.

This is useful when the DHCP server reassigns IP addresses to different systems, which can cause a  
**"Host Key Verification Failed"** error when attempting to SSH.

## Usage

```bash
./clear_known_hosts.sh
```

---

# `get_ip.sh`

This script retrieves the current IP address assigned to a given MAC address, if a lease exists.

## Usage

```bash
./get_ip.sh <mac_address>
```

---

# `join_station.sh`

This script attaches to a specified stationâ€™s TMUX session by its number.  
If a TMUX session for the station does not already exist, the script creates one.

This session appears as a green bar at the bottom of your terminal, labeled with `[stn_#]` on the left.

### Tips
- To detach from the station session: press `CTRL+B D`
- To enter *copy mode* (to scroll through history and copy text): press `CTRL+B [`

## Usage

```bash
./join_station.sh <station_number>
```

---

# `l10_test.sh`

This script automatically runs the L10 test.  
Before running, ensure the system is properly set up:
- Power connected
- Coolant connected
- Ethernet connected

You will also need to scan the following, as found on the system label:
- BMC MAC address
- HOST MAC address
- Service Tag
- Configuration Number

If you add the `-o` flag to the end of the command, the script will display a module selection menu after scanning the system information.  
You can then choose which specific module(s) you would like to run.

Once the system boots, a second TMUX session is automatically created between the L10 server and the Gaines system under test.  
This session appears as a second green bar at the bottom of your terminal, labeled with the `[SERVICE TAG]` on the left.

**Note:** This script must be run inside a TMUX session.  
To join a TMUX session, use [`join_station.sh`](#join_stationsh).

## Usage

```bash
./l10_test.sh [-o]
```

### Options

- `-o` â€” Prompt to select which module(s) to run.
## Usage

---

# `list_stations.sh`

This script lists all stations that currently have an associated TMUX session.  
This is useful for getting a quick CLI view of which stations are active.

## Usage

```bash
./list_stations.sh
```

---

# `restart_pxe_services.sh`

If the system starts behaving unexpectedly (e.g., IP addresses not being assigned, PXE OS not loading), it may be due to one or more PXE-related services on the L10 server being in a non-working state.  

This script restarts the following services to restore PXE functionality:
1. TFTP Server
2. DHCP Server
3. HTTP Server

**Note:** This script must be run as the `root` user.

## Usage

```bash
sudo ./restart_pxe_services.sh
```

---

# `restart_station.sh`

If a TMUX station becomes unresponsive, you can detach from the station using `CTRL+B D`, then run this script to restart it.  

**Note:** Any programs currently running on that station will be terminated when it is restarted.

## Usage

```bash
./restart_station.sh <session_number>
```
